# Arcane

Arcane is a library/framework built on top of [Heaps](https://github.com/HeapsIO/heaps)
### Disclaimer!
***This library is made by me for me, so don't expect me to add documentation or such. I'll add it later.***

Quick explanation of the different packages

- `arcane.Engine` Stuff for adding update loops and such.
- `arcane.signal.*` Signal stuff, should be pretty obvious.
- `arcane.physics.*` Physics. **Not implemented!**
- `arcane.script.*` CLI stuff. Might move to somewhere else
- `arcane.utils.*` Utils. *Obvious, right?*
- `arcane.xml.*` Utilities related to my mod handling system.
- `arcane.controls.*` Controls. *Obvious, right?*
- `arcane.display.*` Nothing for now.
- `arcane.adv.*` More advanced stuff, such as the base app class and such.
- `arcane.adv.sound.*` Sound. Should be used via `Engine.sound`.
- `arcane.adv.macros.*` Macro stuff. Doesn't have much.

## Contributions

Just do a pull request with code that works. If you want a feature, you can always ask me, *but don't expect me to implement it anytime soon.*
